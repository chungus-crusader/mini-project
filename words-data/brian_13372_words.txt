Judith
I
do
feel
Reg
that
any
antiimperialistic
group
like
ours
must
reflect
such
a
divergence
of
interest
within
its
powerbase
Reg
Agreed
Rogers
Rogers
Yes
I
think
Judiths
point
of
view
is
very
valid
Reg
provided
the
movement
never
forgets
that
it
is
the
unalienable
right
of
every
man
Stan
Or
woman
Rogers
or
woman
to
rid
himself
Stan
Or
herself
Rogers
or
herself
Reg
Agreed
Rogers
Thank
you
brother
Stan
Or
sister
Rogers
Or
sister
where
was
I
Reg
I
think
youd
finished
Rogers
Oh
Right
Reg
Further
more
it
it
the
birthright
of
every
man
Stan
Or
woman
Reg
Why
dont
you
shut
up
about
women
Stan
Youre
putting
us
off
Stan
Women
have
a
perfect
right
to
play
a
part
in
our
movement
Reg
Rogers
Why
are
you
always
on
about
women
Stan
Stan
I
want
to
be

Reg
What
Stan
I
want
to
be
a
woman
From
now
on
I
want
you
all
to
call
me
Loretta
Reg
What
Loretta
Its
my
right
as
a
man
Judith
Well
why
do
you
want
to
be
Loretta
Stan
Loretta
I
want
to
have

Reg
You
want

Loretta
Its
every
mans
right
to
have

Reg
But
you

Loretta
Dont

Reg
Im
not

you
Stan
You

Youre

Loretta
Sniff
Judith
Here
Ive
got
an
idea
Suppose
you
agree
that
he
cant
actually
have
babies
not
having
a
womb
which
is
nobodys
fault
not
even
the
Romans
but
that
he
can
have
the
right
to
have
babies
Rogers
Good
idea
Judith
We
shall
fight
the
oppressors
for
your
right
to
have
babies
brother
Sister
Sorry
Reg
Whats
the
point
Rogers
What
Reg
Whats
the
point
of
fighting
for
his
right
to
have
babies
when
he
cant
have
babies
Rogers
It
is
symbolic
of
our
struggle
against
opression
Reg
Symbolic
of
his
struggle
against
reality
